# FunctionAnalysis (WIP)
University of Houston - Numerical Analysis, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan


This was made purely for learning purposes. I neded to save what I learned in this course.

Must use the tools carefully. There is no guarantee that any of these methods will work for all possible functions. They each have their own quirks and assumptions
that must be satisfied. For example, with the built in function(f or df), using findall(0,2) will produce the wrong result, but findall(1,2) will work as intended and so on.
Bugs should only be of this mathematical nature.
