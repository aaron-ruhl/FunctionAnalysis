# FunctionAnalysis (WIP)
University of Houston - Numerical Analysis, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan


This was made purely for learning purposes. I neded to save what I learned in this course.

Must use the tools carefully. Each method has assumptions that must be satisfied. 
For example, with the built in function(f or df), using findall(0,2) will produce the wrong result, but findall(1,2) will work as intended.
Bugs can also be of a mathematical nature, especially in terms of convergence.
