# FunctionAnalysis
University of Houston - Numerical Analysis, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan


This was made purely for learning purposes. I neded to save what I learned in this course.

Must use the tools carefully there is no guarantee any of these methods will always work. They each have their own assumptions
that must be satisfied. For example, with the built in function(f or df), using findall(0,2) will produce the wrong result, but findall(1,2) will work as intended and so on.
Bugs will mostly be of this mathematical nature.
