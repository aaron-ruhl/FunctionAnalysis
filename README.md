I have not added sophisticated error or case handling. Each method has assumptions that must be satisfied so bugs can also be of a mathematical nature; especially in terms of convergence. Mostly just for tinkering currently.


For example, 

try 'f1 = Function(f)', then 'findall(0,2)'. This will produce the wrong result, but 'findall(1,2)' will work as intended and find the correct zero of f on the interval (0,2).
